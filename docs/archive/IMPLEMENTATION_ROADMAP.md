## Risk Factors
1. **Complexity Management**: PE mechanics are intricate
2. **Balance**: Ensuring fair and challenging gameplay
3. **Performance**: Large state with many calculations
4. **Determinism**: Ensuring reproducible outcomes
5. **Scope Creep**: Feature expansion vs. stability

## Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first
2. **Incremental Progress**: Small, working commits
3. **Code Review**: All changes reviewed
4. **Documentation**: Update docs with code
5. **Performance Budget**: Monitor bundle size
6. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
7. **Security**: Input validation, XSS prevention
8. **Modularity**: Loosely coupled components
